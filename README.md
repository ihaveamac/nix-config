# nix config

This is my config for NixOS, nix-darwin, and home-manager.

My config probably sucks, don't use this!!!

The roots of this config start in November 2023 when I was first learning how to use Nix and Home Manager on the Steam Deck. Since then it's sprawled out into a repository for all of my devices.
